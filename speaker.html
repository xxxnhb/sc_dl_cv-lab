                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Converging technological advances in sensing, machine learning and computing offer tremendous opportunities for continuous contextually rich yet unobtrusive multimodal, spatiotemporal characterization of an individual’s behavior and state, and of the environment within which they operate.  This in turn is enabling novel possibilities for understanding and supporting various aspects of human-centered applications notably in psychological health and well-being.   This talk will highlight some of the advances, opportunities and challenges in gathering human-focused data and creating algorithms for machine processing of such cues.  It will report efforts in Behavioral Signal Processing (BSP)—technology and algorithms for quantitatively and objectively understanding typical, atypical and distressed human behavior—with a specific focus on communicative, affective and social behavior. 
                    Examples will be drawn from health and wellbeing realms such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Couple therapy, Depression, Suicidality, and work place behavior. It will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in creating trustworthy signal processing and machine learning approaches that are inclusive, equitable, robust, safe and secure e.g., with respect to protected variables such as gender/race/age/ability etc.

                    Rethinking WMMSE in The Era of Massive MIMO
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Precoding design for maximizing weighted sumrate (WSR) is a fundamental problem for downlink of massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. 
                    It is well-known that this problem is generally NP-hard due to the presence of multi-user interference. The weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm is a popular approach for WSR maximization. 
                    However, its computational complexity is cubic in the number of base station (BS) antennas, which is unaffordable when the BS is equipped with an extremely large antenna array. 
                    In this talk, we will reshape the classical WMMSE with theoretical guarantee and linear complexity (i.e., scales linearly with the number of BS antennas). 
                    Moreover, we show that the novel WMMSE algorithm can be also used to reduce the communication overhead for coordinated multi-point transmission.

                    Concurrent Order Dispatch for Instant Delivery with Time-Constrained Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    In this talk, I will first introduce some key concepts of data-driven cyber-physical systems in smart cities including (i) mobile sensing and communication based on data collected from IoT devices, (ii) data-fusion and cross-domain prediction, 
                    and (iii) intelligent decision-making. 
                    Then, I will introduce our group’s work on the applications of Human Cyber-Physical Systems in smart cities with a concrete use case, i.e., 
                    concurrent order dispatch for instant delivery with strict deadlines. 
                    Thanks to the rapid development of online digital platforms, instant delivery services have developed rapidly in recent years and significantly changed the lifestyle of people. 
                    In instant delivery, the delivery process needs to be finished in a short time. Given the massive number of orders and the limited number of couriers, it is essential to make appropriate dispatch decisions to improve delivery efficiency. 
                    Based on a large number of historical delivery records, I will provide some data-driven findings and unique challenges of order dispatch in instant delivery. 
                    A time-constrained reinforcement learning-based order dispatch framework is proposed, which models concurrent order dispatch as a sequential decision-making problem and optimizes dispatch decisions with actor-critic reinforcement learning. 
                    Finally, I will discuss a few new challenges and open problems in on-demand delivery and intelligent logistics.

                    Learning in the Real World: Diverse, Spatial, Temporal Dependent Data
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    In the real world, data comes from many different sources (e.g., multiple devices), with inter-dependencies (across sources, aka spatial dependencies) and intra-dependencies (across time), multiple types, and different nature (e.g., weather patterns, traffic counts). Deep Learning (DL) has shown significant improvements in computer vision and natural language with ever larger and more sophisticated deep models. But in many other application domains, annotated data is scarce, data dependencies are of paramount significance, and often there is prior knowledge and there are extensive libraries of data processing methods and algorithms that have served us well in the past. In this lecture, we consider some of these issues – adopting graphs to capture data spatial dependencies, and strategies to learn from such complicated diverse data. We illustrate our results with benchmark datasets and real-world applications (e.g., traffic flows and taxi requests in urban environments).

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Data today is often generated from a diverse sources, including social, citation, biological, and physical infrastructure. Unlike time-series signals or images, such signals possess complex and irregular structures, which can be modeled as graphs. Analyzing graph signals requires dealing with the underlying irregular relationships. To achieve this, graph convolutional networks and variants permeats the benefits of deep learning to the graph domain, achieving remarkable success in social network analysis, traffic analysis and quantum chemistry. However, many network architectures are designed through trial and error. It is thus hard to explain the design rationale and further improve the architectures.

                    As mankind, we can accomplish various intelligence capabilities, such as vision, language, and science, simply by using a single neuron organ called the cerebral cortex. The pre-training of cortical nerons for different capabilities also relies heavily on a similar mechanism of predictive learning. These unified biological mechanisms have enabled human beings to adapt quickly and effectively to new environments and acquire new capabilities without millions of years' biological evolution.

                    In artificial intelligence, architectures and learning methods in various domains are also converging. Transformer, which emerges in the field of NLP, is now taking over previous domain-specific architectures in several fields, such as computer vision, speech, science, etc. Masked signal modeling or predictive learning has also been shown to be very effective in all of NLP, vision, and speech. This talk will introduce the journey towards these convergences, as well as the representative works that have driven this trend. The talk will also present several recent research efforts by the speaker's team, including Local Relation Networks, Swin Transformer V1/V2, SimMIM, etc.

                    Learning for the Future Power Grid
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Advanced learning frameworks are reshaping the landscape of power grid operation and the electricity market design. 
                    This talk shares two stories, both of which seek to use learning frameworks to enhance the future power grid. 
                    The first one investigates the storage control problem for consumers. Specifically, we consider that consumers face dynamic electricity prices and seek to use storage to reduce their electricity bills. 
                    The challenges come from the uncertainty in the electricity price and consumers' demand. We propose a practical learning-based online storage control policy. 
                    The second story studies a classical procedure in the electricity market, the economic dispatch problem, i.e., matching the electricity supply and demand at the minimal generation cost. 
                    The critical challenge is again from the uncertainty in the system demand. Hence, the conventional approach is to conduct the dispatch based on predicted demand. 
                    However, we submit that this conventional approach can be suboptimal, and we propose a model-free algorithm for economic dispatch based on the end-to-end learning framework.

                    Puzzles in Perceptual Image Quality Assessment and Processing
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Perceptual image quality assessment and perceptually motivated processing have drawn a great deal of attention in the past two decades. 
                    While a large number of methods have been developed for a wide variety of applications, somewhat surprisingly, limited thoughts have been put on accurately formulating the problem and clearly defining the performance evaluation criterion. 
                    In this talk, we would like to share some of the puzzles we have for open discussion. For example, classical image processing problems such as image restoration and image enhancement are often evaluated and compared either by some quality metric of the reconstructed images or by certain signal fidelity/distortion measure between the original and reconstructed images, but we argue that neither of them is precisely the desired target for image restoration or enhancement. 
                    While some compromise between the two might be a better option, there is a lack of clean theory or methodology to determine the balancing point. 
                    Although a Bayesian interpretation may offer useful insights and potential solutions, the instantiations are often constrained by specific distortion processes. 
                    In addition, whether the prior or posterior probability of images produces an appropriate representation of perceptual image quality is yet another question up to debate. 
                    Recently, there has been some interesting discussion on the idea of the “perception-distortion tradeoff”, aiming to find some theoretical compromise between quality (perception) and distortion, but the quality (perception) is defined by the divergence between the distributions of the original and reconstructed images, which makes the problem even more perplexing. 
                    We hope this talk can invite some insightful discussions, which may help with our future effort on perceptual image quality assessment and processing.

                    Exploring and Exploiting the Universality Phenomena in High-Dimensional Estimation and Learning
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Universality is a fascinating and truly high-dimensional phenomenon. It points to the existence of universal laws that govern the macroscopic behavior of wide classes of large and complex systems, despite their differences in microscopic details. 
                    The notion of universality originated in statistical mechanics, especially in the study of phase transitions. Similar phenomena have been observed in probability theory, dynamical systems, random matrix theory, and number theory. 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    In this talk, I will present some recent progresses in rigorously understanding and exploiting the universality phenomena in the context of statistical estimation and learning on high-dimensional data. Examples include spectral methods for high-dimensional projection pursuit, statistical learning based on kernel and random feature models, and approximate message passing algorithms on structured and nearly deterministic data matrices. Together, they demonstrate the robustness and wide applicability of the universality phenomena.

                    Machine Learning based Semantic Signal Processing and Communications

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Recent advances in machine learning enabled real time extraction of semantic information in sensor data. By taking advantage of this development, a novel framework for goal oriented semantic signal processing and communications is proposed. Unlike classical approaches where sensor data is encoded and transmitted to a processing unit in the network, in the proposed framework, semantic information in the sensor data is extracted in real time by using machine learning techniques at the sensor node. To enable efficient goal-oriented signal processing on the extracted semantic information, a hierarchical graph-based semantic language is used.  In this way, semantic filtering of the extracted information can be achieved at the sensor node resulting in a dramatic reduction in the rate of communication in the network.  Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated over real video data obtained in a parking lot and in a simulated smart city environment.
