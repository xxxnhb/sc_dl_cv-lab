                    AI in Medical and Biological Engineering

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of mimicking human intelligences and behaviors.
                    Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, trains a machine how to use algorithms or statistics
                    to find hidden insights and learn automatically from data. Deep learning (DL) is one of machine
                    learning methods where we use deep neural networks with advanced algorithms such as auto-encoding
                    or convolution to recognize patterns in data. AI has become very successful recently due to the
                    availability of huge data and powerful supercomputers. Many applications such as speech and face
                    recognition, image classification, natural language processing, bioinformatics, health informatics
                    such as disease prediction and detection suddenly took great leaps due to the advance of AI.
                    Although various AI architectures and novel algorithms have been invented for many bio and health
                    applications, better explainability, increasing prediction accuracy and speeding up the training
                    process are still challenging tasks among others. In this talk, I will outline recent developments
                    in AI research for bioinformatics and health informatics. The topics discussed include proposing
                    more effective architectures, intelligently freezing layers, gradient amplification, effectively
                    handling high dimensional data, designing encoding schemes, mathematical proofs, optimization of
                    hyper-parameters, effective use of prior knowledge, embedding logic and reasoning during training,
                    result explanation and hardware support. These challenges create a huge number of opportunities
                    for people in both computer science and health care. In this talk, some of our solutions and
                    preliminary results in these areas will be presented and future research directions will also
                    be identified.

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Beidou and other satellite positioning technologies are becoming more and more mature.
                    By 2035, China will build a more ubiquitous integrated positioning system based on Beidou.
                    Due to the limitation of indoor application of satellite positioning technology, high accuracy
                    indoor positioning technology is still a big challenge to build this ubiquitous positioning
                    system. Focusing on high-precision positioning technology, this presentation focuses on BLE
                    AOA and ranging technology and its application for massive Bluetooth-based devices.

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Intelligent Internet of Things technology is an inevitable product of the rapid development of
                    artificial intelligence technology and Internet of Things technology. The design and implementation
                    of integrated Internet of Things nodes with continuous intelligent perception capabilities is the
                    promising way for various terminal devices to achieve intelligence, and it is also the solution to
                    the current Internet of Things, which are the key technologies for reducing system power
                    consumption, real-time performance, security and privacy. This article reviews the emerging
                    "Senputing Architecture, Sensing with Computing" including system architecture and the new
                    paradigm of integrated circuit design for intelligent continuous perception. First, the intelligent
                    visual perception integrated system is the breakthrough point. The goal is to integrate artificial
                    intelligence under the new processing architecture. The processing task is closely integrated with
                    the visual sensor to realize an ultra-low-power intelligent visual acquisition and analysis chip
                    that can work continuously, and expand to a variety of perception modes such as auditory perception
                    and tactile perception. This presentation will introduce the multi-dimensional scalable exploration

                    Spectral sensing everywhere

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Seetrum’s chip-scale hyperspectral sensor integrates metasurface technology and wide-spectrum
                    dispersion characteristics and includes a novel algorithm framework. Compared with commercialized
                    spectrometers, we have miniaturized the bulky and expensive spectrometer to only 1% of its size and
                    cost, with an outstanding spectral resolution of 0.8 nm. Compared with leading researches worldwide,
                    our achievement features smaller spectral pixel, higher spectral resolution, and wider spectral
                    range. However, the most important advantage is that our technology is perfectly compatible with
                    the CMOS process, making massive and cheap production available. Our technology was reviewed by the
                    international top journal “Science” this year and listed as the latest research achievement in this
                    field. Seetrum would lead the expensive hyperspectral sensing to our daily life and make spectral
                    sensing everywhere.

                    Seetrum is committed to providing advanced spectral chips, AI algorithms, and intelligent sensing
                    solutions, empowering the industries and supporting our customers' efficient development. We are
                    a high-tech company that originated from Tsinghua University. We have innovated a snapshot CMOS
                    hyperspectral imaging chip with high resolution, low cost, and massive production ability, which
                    will expand sensing applications in smartphone, medical device, machine vision, AR, autopilot,
                    smart city, etc. We are making spectral sensing everywhere.
